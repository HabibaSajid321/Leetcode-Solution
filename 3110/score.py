# You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.
# Return the score of s.
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "hello"
# Output: 13
# Explanation:
# The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'h' = 104, 'e' = 101, 'l' = 108, 'o' = 111. So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.

def strScore(s):
    score = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        score += abs(ord(s[i]) - ord(s[i + 1]))
    return score
